                    <p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Employee and Executive</strong> curricula are automatically assigned and can be found on the My Plan page in Saba</p>
                    <p><strong>Managers</strong> need to self-identify for your curriculum based on your function before it will be automatically loaded into your Saba profile (e.g. Supervisor/Team Leader, without financial delegation, financial delegation only, or with financial and staffing delegation).

                    <p>The new curricula consist of courses that are already found in Saba. In addition, certain CSPS courses are also available in Saba.</p>
