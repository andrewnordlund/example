        <p>Why are the usual strategies used online not accessible and not an option for us? The following CAPTCHA’s are
            typically used to prevent BOT attacks but are not accessible or fully compliant, and/or have other
            identified challenges.</p>
        <h2>CAPTCHAs</h2>
        <h3>Image based CAPTCHA’s</h3>
        <p>Not accessible as visually impaired people cannot see the images and input the requested information.</p>
        <h3>Audio CAPTCHA</h3>
        <p>This will work with the screen readers, as the user can “hear” the word(s), but it can be exploited by smart
            and presents the same problem as Image Based CAPTCHA’s for the visually impaired. Here is an <a href="https://gbhackers.com/security-researcher-breaks-googles-recaptcha-v2-using-googles-tool/">audio CAPTCHA</a> that covers it in details.</p>
        <h3>reCAPTCHA</h3>
        <p>Uses digitized words but presents the same problem as Image Based CAPTCHA’s for the visually impaired.</p>
        <h2>Alternative methods</h2>
        <p>In addition to the above mentioned CAPTCHA’s. the following are also used to prevent attacks.</p>
        <h3>Common names are not used for attributes</h3>
        <p>When bots crawl, they typically look for common field names like email address, name etc. This information
            can be made obscure as a way to deter bots but it would be confusing for our legitimate end users. This
            option is accessible, but not user friendly.</p>
        <h3>Hidden input fields</h3>
        <p>A field that is not required for business can be hidden using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). A BOT would
            typically complete this hidden field and upon Submit, we can check if that field has data and if it does we
            simply reject submission. This option is accessible, but can be hacked.</p>
        <h3>Random question</h3>
        <p>Random questions can be asked based on “other” input from the user. For example: What is the second and
            seventh digit of your phone number. This option is accessible, but can be hacked and there is a significant
            level of effort required to implement this option.</p>
        <h3>Email address field/confirmation process</h3>
        <p>Capturing an email address and implementing an email confirmation process protects against BOT attacks
            because an email which contains a unique confirmation link is sent to the user immediately after form
            submission. Successful confirmation via this link verifies the authenticity of the user and persists the
            data. If the subscription is not confirmed, within a period of time as identified by the business, the data
            is discarded. This ensures that the data committed to the database is from actual users and not BOT
            submissions, which in-turn ensures the integrity and accuracy of the Youth Service data.</p>
        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p>To further secure the form data, it is recommended that the following additional functionality be
            implemented as further security.</p>
        <h4>Hidden input fields</h4>
        <p>Although as mentioned above, on its own this option is not completely secure but when used with the email
            address/confirmation process it adds an additional layer to protect data and is not difficult to implement.
            To ensure accessibility and compliance, this field will be hidden visually and from screen readers, and the
            input value of this field will be checked before accepting submission of data.</p>
        <h2>Recommendation</h2>
        <p>Implementation of the following methods for the web form are recommended to optimize user
            experience and accessibility, as well as ensure data integrity and accuracy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Include a required email address field/confirmation process and persist data only upon successful
                confirmation.</li>
            <li>Enable hidden field validation on form submission.</li>
        </ul>
