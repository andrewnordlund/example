                    <p>People with hearing loss may struggle with using video conference applications. You might want to consider the following accommodations.</p>
                    <p>Accessibility Solution for Deaf, deafened and hard of hearing people: CART services can be offered to participants who are typically hard of hearing. Keep in mind that people who are culturally Deaf, will prefer to have sign language interpreters because their first language is likely LSQ or ASL. But don&rsquo;t assume this. Ask them what their prefered accommodation would be.</p>
